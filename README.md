The goal of this project is to become familier with Ros2, the Neatos, and the systems around them that we 
will be using throughout this course. We started with basic driving to gather an understanding of subscribers 
and publishers but through this project have learned to use the lidar scanner, bump sensor, and Twist movement commands to create both teleop and autonomous movement. These behaviors were what we completed by the end.
